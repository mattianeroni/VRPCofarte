# VRP with stochastic travel times
An algorithm to improve the last-mile delivery of drugs to pharmacies.


The algorithm is partially inspired by similar algorithms in literature on Vehicle Routing Problem, but it considers additional constraints, such as the unpredictability of travel times due to traffic conditions, the different importance of customers, and the time windows (i.e., customers can receive the shipment only in a predefined time period).
